<img src="images/sanjay.jpg" style="width:25%; border:10px solid; margin-right: 20px" align="left">In the community I mentor and support scouts to build on their life skills. I volunteers at various events as Archery Range Officer and other community events/fundraisers for non-profit organizations.

 
At home I spend time with my family, grilling and being outdoors, reading books, fixing house hold equipment and working on small home improvement projects.

"Has anyone seen my glasses, I am missing them again?" and the unanimous reply from my family is always "Did you check with Hero?"


Things I have acomplished: Winning against both of my kids at “words with friends”, solving the Rubik’s cube, get to 4096 at 2048 (a fun app if you have not tried it). I am a NRA Certified a Range Safety Officer, NFAA Certified Archery Instructor, Certified Enterprise Architect for J2EE Technology and have several patents granted and few more under review.
